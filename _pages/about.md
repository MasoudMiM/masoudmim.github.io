Welcome to my corner of the digital space! I'm Masoud Masoumi, a passionate problem solver with a strong academic foundation in Engineering, Data Analytics, and Machine Learning. My expertise lies in harnessing cutting-edge technologies to address complex challenges. Beyond the classroom, I've immersed myself in research, exploring applications of machine learning and data analytics in science and engineering. 

In addition to my academic pursuits, I've earned certificates in Applied Mathematics and Data Analytics and completed specialized training in Deep Learning. My professional trajectory spans a spectrum of projects, ranging from predicting stress fields using Convolutional Neural Networks and designing electricity consumption models with real-time energy data to implementing Large Language Models and Natural Language Processing to tackle various tasks. I've also delved into data analytics and machine learning solutions for atmospheric data analysis and predictions.

Since leaving my full-time academic position, I worked as a Physical Scientist at the Hydrographic Surveys Division within the Office of Coast Survey, part of NOAAâ€™s National Ocean Service. In this role, I was primarily responsible for all phases of automated workflow development for the [National Bathymetric Source](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-bathymetry) model, including design, algorithm and software development, testing, and documentation. I also spent about a year at the Internal Revenue Service as a Data Scientist, where I focused on exploring novel data retrieval methods and providing innovative recommendations for data-driven decisions. Additionally, I collaborated with business and technology partners to understand their needs and implement analytical solutions. My responsibilities also included cleaning, transforming, analyzing, and integrating structured and unstructured data from various sources, as well as troubleshooting and proposing solutions to project bottlenecks.
